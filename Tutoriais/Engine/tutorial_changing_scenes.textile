h3(#introduction). Introduction

Changing a scene in Godot is not often as straightforward, this is due to the high flexibility offered by the scene system. As there is nothing that really defines a &quot;loaded scene&quot;, this must be done manually.

The advantage of this is that it's easy to handle different common situations, such as loading screens (with progress bar), transitions (fadeins/fadeouts), preloaded scenes, etc.
