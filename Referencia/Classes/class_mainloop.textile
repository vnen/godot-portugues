h3(#description). Description

Main loop is the abstract main loop base class. All other main loop classes are derived from it. Upon application start, a "MainLoop":class_mainloop has to be provided to OS, else the application will exit. This happens automatically (and a [SceneMainLoop] is created), unless a main "Script":class_script is supplied, which may or not create and return a "MainLoop":class_mainloop.
