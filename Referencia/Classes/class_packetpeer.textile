h3(#description). Description

PacketPeer is an abstration and base class for packet&#45;based protocols (such as UDP). It provides an API for sending and receiving packets both as raw data or variables. This makes it easy to transfer data over a protocol, without having to encode data as low level bytes or having to worry about network ordering.
