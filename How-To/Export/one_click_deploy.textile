This feature will pop up automatically once a platform is properly configured and a supported device is connected to the computer. Since things can go wrong at many levels (platform may not be configured correctly, SDK may incorrectly installed, device may be improperly configured, kitty ate the USB cable, etc.), it's good to let the user know that it exists.

Some platforms (at the time of this writing, only Android and Blackberry 10) can detect when a USB device is connected to the computer, and offer the user to automatically export, install and run the project (in debug mode) on the device. This feature is called, in industry buzz&#45;words, &quot;One Click Deploy&quot; (though, it's technically two clicks...).
